## Tips for Implementation

1. **Test as You Go**: After implementing each component, test it thoroughly before moving to the next.

2. **Use Branch-based Development**: Create a branch for each phase or major feature to isolate changes.

3. **Regular Backups**: Back up your database regularly during development.

4. **Incremental Deployment**: Deploy smaller changes more frequently to reduce risk.

5. **Monitor Performance**: Keep an eye on database performance as the feedback collection grows.

6. **Use Mock Data**: Create realistic mock data for testing before you have real user feedback.

7. **User Testing**: If possible, have team members test the feedback system in the chat interface.

This sequential approach should help you implement the feedback system and dashboard in a manageable way, with clear checkpoints to ensure everything works correctly before moving forward.

# Feedback Submission Issue and Resolution

## The Issue
We were encountering a 401 Unauthorized error when trying to submit feedback in the chat interface. The error occurred because:

1. The feedback endpoint was being treated as a protected route requiring authentication, when it should have been public
2. The message IDs were not being consistently handled between the frontend components
3. The feedback submission flow had a mismatch in how message IDs were being used to update the UI state

## The tried Solutions
We made several key changes to fix these issues:

### 1. API Service Configuration
- Updated the request interceptor in `apiService.js` to properly identify public endpoints
- Added `/api/feedback` to the list of public endpoints that don't require authentication
- Improved error handling and logging for feedback submissions

### 2. Message ID Handling
- Modified the `MessageList` component to ensure consistent message IDs:
  ```javascript
  messageId={msg.id || `msg_${Date.now()}_${index}`}
  ```
- Added proper fallback for conversation IDs:
  ```javascript
  conversationId={msg.conversationId || `conv_${Date.now()}`}
  ```

### 3. Feedback Submission Flow
- Updated the `handleFeedback` function in `useMessages.js` to correctly find and update messages using their IDs:
  ```javascript
  setMessages(prev => prev.map(msg => 
    msg.id === feedbackData.messageId
      ? { ...msg, feedbackSubmitted: true }
      : msg
  ));
  ```
- Improved validation in the `MessageFeedback` component to ensure required fields are present
- Added better error handling and user feedback during the submission process
